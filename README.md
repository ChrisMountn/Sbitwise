# Sbitwise
Solidity practice project - backend for a DAPP that mimics the functionality of "Splitwise", but with a built-in transfer system via the ethereum blockchain. 

I do not intend to put this idea into production, but it was good practice for writing and testing solidity code wth Truffle, Mocha, and Chai.
